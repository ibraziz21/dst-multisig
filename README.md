#Joint Wallet Multisig
A web3 company has 2 members of the team, with 50/50 shares of the company. To keep it fair, the companyâ€™s tokens are kept in a separate wallet of which both members have access to. A bad actor among them could send the tokens out maliciously and bankrupting the business and leaving their partner in the cold. Luckily, The Team holds only 2 tokens;

Our Solution to this is creating a Multisig Wallet.

The personal account addresses of both parties will be whitelisted
Deposits can be done to the company from external sources, as well as the whitelisted members.
Transfers from the Multisig Wallet limited to only whitelisted members.
If member A sends tokens out, the smart contract waits for Confirmation from member B before completing the transaction.
